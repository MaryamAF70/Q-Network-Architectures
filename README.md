# Q-Network-Architectures
This folder contains four neural network models used for Q-value approximation in Deep Reinforcement Learning. Each architecture is designed for a different type of state representation and task.
# Models Overview
CNN_QNetwork → Convolutional model for visual or spatial input (e.g., Atari games).

LSTM_QNetwork → Sequential model with memory, suitable for partially observable or time-dependent environments.

RNN_QNetwork → Lightweight recurrent model for temporal data.

QNetwork (MLP) → Fully connected network for simple, low-dimensional environments like CartPole.
